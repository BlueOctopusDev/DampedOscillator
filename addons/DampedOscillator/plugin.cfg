description="Here's a little something for you to animate values such as floats, ints and Vector2. You just have to write DampedOscillator.animate(node, propertie, string, damp, velocity) and your value will be animated.
See the demo for more infos on how to use it. (Original idea from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBgCUQVDRkw&ab_channel=MrElipteach)"
